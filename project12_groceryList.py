'''
You have been provided with a file groceryList.py.  This program prompts the user for grocery items, and stores them in a list â€“ allowing the user to print and check on list contents.  Look at the code so that you understand the existing structure.  You are going to UPDATE this program in the following manner:

 

Part 1:

Before exiting, ask the user for the name of an output file.  Open the file and write the stored grocery items to the file, one item per line.  Be sure and close the file once you are done writing to it. 

Part 2:

Once you are sure Part 1 works correctly (you should be able to view the output file using a text editor), you are going to introduce simple data persistence.

When your program first starts, prompt the user for the name of an input file that is expected to contain grocery items, one item/line.  (The first time you run the program,  make sure this file exists).  Open the file,  and read the items one at at time, appending them to an empty list.  The program is to then continue on to offer the user the options as before. 

As before, just prior to the program exit,  the grocery items which are stored are to be written to an output file.

The overall effect of the additions to this program allow for data to be stored between program runs.  The file used as output from one run can be used for input for a subsequent run .. accumulating names from each run.

 

SUBMIT your updated groceryList.py file.
