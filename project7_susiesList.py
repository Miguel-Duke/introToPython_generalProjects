
'''Week 7 project Susies List by Mike Schwartz'''



'''Your friend Susie has a problem.  She goes grocery shopping on a weekly basis, and always seems to forget to buy items that she needs.  You have suggested that she make a list before she goes, and have offered to write a program to help Susie produce her list.

Your program should define at least 2 functions to help perform the above tasks:

addItem(alist)

  The function addItem accepts one parameter, which is a list. This function  

  prompts the user for an item to be added to the list.  If the item is not already

  on the list, the item is added to the end of the list. Otherwise, a message is  

  given indicating that the item is already on the list.

 

removeItem(alist)

  The function addItem accepts one parameter, which is a list. This function

  prompts the user for an item to be removed from the list. If the item on the list,

  it is removed from the list. Otherwise, a message is given indicating that the

  item was not on the list.

 

printOut(alist)

The function printOut accepts one parameter, which is a list.  This function prints out a header: GROCERY LIST

followed by a list of all of the items in the list, one at a time

 

The main part of your program will start by creating an empty list.   The user will then be allowed to choose any of the following UNTIL he/she wishes to exit.

  * ADD an item to the list

           The user will provide the item to be added. If the item is not on the list, it will be added,

           otherwise a message will be given that  the item is already on the list.

           (You will call your addItem function to help here)

  * FIND an item on the list

          The user will provide an item and the program will report if the item is

          already on the list or not.

  * PRINT all items

           All items on the list are to be printed out, one per line   (function printOut helps here)

  * REMOVE an item from the list

           The user will provide an item to be removed.  If itâ€™s there, it is removed, otherwise a

           message is given.   (You will call your removeItem function to help here)

 

Be sure your program is readable and well-commented.  Test all options, remember some choices have two paths (eg.   choosing ADD will either add an item or print a message). 

If you wish, you may place your three functions in their own file (module) and import this file into your main.  Not only is this a more professional touch, but doing so is a good way to ensure that you are not using any global variables in your function!!!'''
